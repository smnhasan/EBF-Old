abstract = {Background Undernutrition is common and has been recognized as a public health problem in Bangladesh. It has devastating effects on any population as it increases morbidity children and reduces the quality of life of all affected. The study was done with the objective to assess the undernutrition and morbidity profile in children who have completed exclusive breastfeeding. Methods This was a descriptive cross-sectional study, which was carried out among children aged 6-12 completed months attending a tertiary level hospital in Bangladesh. A total of 251 children were selected through convenient sampling from January to December 2015. Nutritional assessment was done in terms of underweight, stunting, and wasting. Results One hundred and forty-three (57.0{\%}) were boys while 108 (43.0{\%}) were girls. The prevalence of undernutrition (Z-score ≤-2) was observed in 11.2{\%}, 16.3{\%}, and 12.0{\%} based on stunting, underweight, and wasting. Among 251 children, 16.7{\%} were not suffering any diseases, whereas majorities (69.7{\%}) were suffering from single disease and 13.5{\%} were suffering from multiple diseases. Cough and fever (55.0{\%}), pneumonia (18.3{\%}), measles (9.9{\%}), and diarrhea (8.3{\%}) were the most common cause of infectious morbidity observed in children. Conclusions The prevalence of undernutrition was high in the study population, and it continues to be a public health burden because of its major effect on morbidity and impairment of intellectual and physical development in long-term. Increasing the practice of exclusive breastfeeding, the introduction of timely complementary feeding, and standard case management of morbidities would be beneficial to combat the problem of undernutrition.},

abstract = {Background The objective of this study was to explore predictors of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) in Bangladesh using data from 2007, 2011 and 2014, specifically focusing on potential reasons why rates of EBF changed over those time periods. Methods Data on mother/infant pairs with infants {\textless}6 months of age were examined at the three time points using the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey. The EBF prevalence, changes in EBF since the previous survey and determinants of EBF at each time period were examined using t-tests, $\chi$2 and multilevel logistic regression. Results The prevalence of EBF was 42.5, 65 and 59.4{\%} in 2007, 2011 and 2014, respectively. The age of the child was significantly associated with EBF across all time points. The largest changes in EBF occurred in the 3- to 5-month age group. Predictors of EBF in this specific age group were similar to overall predictors (e.g. age of the child and region). Participation of the mother in household decisions was a significant predictor in 2014. Conclusions EBF prevalence in Bangladesh increased between 2007 and 2011 and then decreased between 2011 and 2014. The increase in 2011 may have been the result of widespread initiatives to promote EBF in that time frame. Due to the unexplained decrease in EBF between 2011 and 2014, there is still a need for interventions such as peer counselling, antenatal education and community awareness to promote EBF.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Bangladesh is one of the 20 countries with highest burden of stunting globally. A large portion (around 2.2 million) of the population dwells in the slum areas under severe vulnerable conditions. Children residing in the slums are disproportionately affected with higher burden of undernutrition particularly stunting. In this paper, findings of a prospective cohort study which is part of a larger multi-country study are presented. METHODS Two hundred and sixty five children were enrolled and followed since their birth till 24 months of age. Anthropometric measurements, dietary intake and morbidity information were collected monthly. Data from 9 to 12, 15-18 and 21-24 months were collated to analyze and report findings for 12, 18 and 24 months of age. Generalized estimating equation models were constructed to determine risk factors of stunting between 12 and 24 months of age. RESULT Approximately, 18{\%} of children were already stunted (LAZ {\textless} -2SD) at birth and the proportion increased to 48{\%} at 24 months of age. Exclusive breastfeeding prevalence was only 9.4{\%} following the WHO definition at 6 months. Dietary energy intake as well as intakes of carbohydrate, fat and protein were suboptimal for majority of the children. However, in regression analysis, LAZ at birth (AOR = 0.40, 95{\%} CI: 0.26, 0.61), household with poor asset index (AOR = 2.81, 95{\%} CI: 1.43, 5.52; ref.: average asset index), being male children (AOR = 1.75, 95{\%} CI: 1.04, 2.95; ref.: female) and age (AOR = 2.34, 95{\%} CI: 1.56, 3.52 at 24 months, AOR = 2.13, 95{\%} CI: 1.55, 2.92 at 18 months; ref.: 12 months of age) were the significant predictors of stunting among this population. CONCLUSION As the mechanism of stunting begins even before a child is born, strategies must be focused on life course approach and preventive measurement should be initiated during pregnancy. Alongside, government and policymakers have to develop sustainable strategies to improve various social and environmental factors those are closely interrelated with chronic undernutrition particularly concentrating on urban slum areas.},

This study aimed to examine the factors influencing the uptake of infant and young child feeding messages promoted in TV spots that were launched and aired nationwide in Bangladesh. We conducted a mixed-methods study, using household surveys (n = 2,000) and semistructured interviews (n = 251) with mothers of children 0-23.9 months and other household members. Factors associated with TV spot viewing and comprehension were analysed using multivariable logistic regression models, and interview transcripts were analysed by systematic coding and iterative summaries. Exposure ranged from 36{\%} to 62{\%} across 6 TV spots, with comprehension ranging from 33{\%} to 96{\%} among those who viewed the spots. Factors associated with comprehension of TV spot messages included younger maternal age and receipt of home visits by frontline health workers. Three direct narrative spots showed correct message recall and strong believability, identification, and feasibility of practicing the recommended behaviours. Two spots that used a metaphorical and indirect narrative style were not well understood by respondents. Understanding the differences in the uptake factors may help to explain variability of impacts and ways to improve the design and implementation of mass media strategies.},

A systematic 5{\%} sample was taken of all children aged 1-35 months attending the treatment centre of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, with acute watery diarrhoea of six days or less between August 1988 and September 1989. There were 285 children with moderate or severe dehydration as cases and 728 with no dehydration as controls in the study. In a multivariate analysis using a logistic regression model we showed that withdrawal of breast feeding during diarrhoea was associated with a five times higher risk of dehydration compared with continuation of breast feeding during diarrhoea at home. Lack of ORT with either complete formula or a salt and sugar solution at home was associated with 57{\%} higher risk of dehydration compared with receipt of a reasonable amount of ORT after controlling for several confounders. The confounding variables--that is, lack of maternal education, history of vomiting, high stool frequency, young age and infection with Vibrio cholerae 01--were also shown to be risk factors of dehydration. Health education programmes should promote continued breast feeding and adequate oral rehydration therapy for infants with acute diarrhoea at home.},

For this reason, this study was designed to find out the specific symptoms, treatment pattern and recovery time of the affected children, infant and neonate. A retrospective study was performed on 50 patients suffering from diarrhea. The study period was from January, 2009 - June, 2009 at Institute of Child health of Shishu Sasthya Foundation Hospital, Mirpur-2, Dhaka - 1216. The Information of the anthropometric measurements, type of feeding, duration of diarrhea, number of stools during the last 24 hours, dehydration status etc. were collected from the hospital records. The oral rehydration solution (ORS), antibiotic therapy or antidiarrhoeal drugs were given to the patients having age range {\textless}1 month to {\textgreater} 24 months also considered. It was found that among 50 patients, 80{\%} infant was affected by diarrhea. Common symptoms for infants were loose watery stool (84.38{\%}), vomiting (80{\%}), fever (87.5{\%}) and loose motion (81.82{\%}). Most of the infant about 87.5{\%} received antibiotic therapy. The treatment provided other than antibiotic therapy was koloride, NPO (Nothing per oral), ORS (Oral Rehydration Solution) etc. After taking the antibiotic therapies with other treatment, 85{\%} infants and 100{\%} neonates were recovered within 1-3 days. This scenario gives a partial feature of diarrhea disease in developing country like Bangladesh.

abstract = {BACKGROUND In developing countries, infectious diseases such as diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections are the main cause of mortality and morbidity in infants aged less than one year. The importance of exclusive breastfeeding in the prevention of infectious diseases during infancy is well known. Although breastfeeding is almost universal in Bangladesh, the rates of exclusive breastfeeding remain low. This cohort study was designed to compare the prevalence of diarrhoea and acute respiratory infection (ARI) in infants according to their breastfeeding status in a prospective cohort of infants from birth to six months of age. METHODS A total of 351 pregnant women were recruited in the Anowara subdistrict of Chittagong. Breastfeeding practices and the 7-day prevalence of diarrhoea and ARI were recorded at monthly home visits. Prevalences were compared using chi-squared tests and logistic regression. RESULTS A total of 272 mother-infant pairs completed the study to six months. Infants who were exclusively breastfed for six months had a significantly lower 7-day prevalence of diarrhoea [AOR for lack of EBF = 2.50 (95{\%}CI 1.10, 5.69), p = 0.03] and a significantly lower 7-day prevalence of ARI [AOR for lack of EBF = 2.31 (95{\%}CI 1.33, 4.00), p {\textless} 0.01] than infants who were not exclusively breastfed. However, when the association between patterns of infant feeding (exclusive, predominant and partial breastfeeding) and illness was investigated in more detail, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of diarrhoea between exclusively [6.6{\%} (95{\%} CI 2.8, 10.4)] and predominantly breastfed infants [3.7{\%} (95{\%} CI 0.09, 18.3), (p = 0.56)]. Partially breastfed infants had a higher prevalence of diarrhoea than the others [19.2{\%} (95{\%} CI 10.4, 27.9), (p = 0.01)]. Similarly, although there was a large difference in prevalence in acute respiratory illness between exclusively [54.2{\%} (95{\%}CI 46.6, 61.8)] and predominantly breastfed infants [70.4{\%} (95{\%}CI 53.2, 87.6)] there was no significant difference in the prevalence (p = 0.17). CONCLUSION The findings suggest that exclusive or predominant breastfeeding can reduce rates of morbidity significantly in this region of rural Bangladesh.},

A cohort of 696 children under 5 years of age was followed for 1 year yielding 183,865 child-days of observation. Trained field workers visited the study children every fourth day. Data on symptoms suggesting ARI, such as fever, cough, and nasal discharge, were collected for the preceding 3 days by recall. To determine the type and severity of ARI, the field workers conducted physical examinations (temperature, rate of respiration, and chest indrawing) of children reporting cough and/or fever. The overall incidence of ARI was 5.5 episodes per child-year observed; the prevalence was 35.4 per hundred days observed. Most of the episodes (96 per cent) were upper respiratory infections (URI). The incidence of acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) was 0.23 per child per year. The incidence of URI was highest in 18-23-month-old children, followed by infants 6-11 months old. The highest incidence of ALRI was observed in 0-5-month-old infants followed by 12-17-month-old children. Among 559 children who were followed for 6 months or longer, about 9 per cent did not suffer any URI episode and about 16 per cent suffered one or more ALRI episodes. About 46 per cent of URI and 65 per cent of ALRI episodes lasted 15 days or more. The incidence rates of URI were higher during the monsoon and pre-winter periods, and that of ALRI at the end of the monsoon and during the pre-winter periods. Sociodemographic variables were not associated with the incidence of URI or ALRI. The study documents ARI to be a major cause of morbidity among rural Bangladeshi children.},

abstract = {Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) are a major cause of death in children under five in rural Bangladesh. A popular strategy for lowering ARI mortality in such settings includes detecting and managing pneumonia in children at the community level. The success of programs using this approach requires a well-trained community-based cadre of health workers and the appropriate utilization of services provided. Determinants of health care seeking behavior are clearly of interest in this regard. A qualitative study was conducted in Matlab, Bangladesh to describe community perceptions of signs and symptoms of ARI, case management behavior, and constraints to service utilization. Mothers recognized pneumonia and thought it to be caused by "exposure to cold." They were able to identify labored breathing, chest retractions, lethargy, and inability to feed as signs of severe disease needing treatment outside the home. Nevertheless, similar illnesses were sometimes believed to be due to attack by evil influences. In these cases, spiritual healers were sought and allopathic treatment was avoided or delayed. The mothers' observance of purdah and "proper" behavior were reported to play a role in prevention of child death from disease. Implications of this belief and its impact on service utilization are discussed. Suggestions for program managers are made in addition to recommendations for further research. 20 case history interviews with mothers of children younger than 5 and 12 focus groups with young and older mothers, mothers-in-law (grandmothers), traditional birth attendants, spiritual healers, and untrained or semitrained allopaths (village doctors) were conducted in the Matlab in Bangladesh. The qualitative research aimed to examine obstacles to service utilization and community beliefs and practices regarding acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in a rural community where an ARI control project operates. Severe signs and symptoms were more likely to upset mothers than grandmothers. Signs that mothers recognized as severe enough to seek treatment outside the home were labored breathing, chest retractions, lethargy, and inability to feed. Mothers believed that exposure to cold was responsible for pneumonia. Yet, they often thought that an attack by evil influences caused similar illnesses. They refrained from or delayed taking their children with an evil-induced illness for allopathic treatment. Instead, they would seek the services of spiritual healers. Previous experience with a successfully treated case of pneumonia (caused by exposure to cold) was the factor most strongly associated with the decision to seek allopathic treatment. The most common external constraint to bringing children to the Matlab hospital was no one at home to do household work, particularly care for other children. Internal constraints included reluctance to violate purdah and fear of traveling alone. Mothers thought that adhering to purdah kept disease attacks from their children. Mother-blaming attitudes were prevalent, which had a negative effect on mothers' ability to obtain appropriate treatment for ill children.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Acute respiratory infection (ARI) is a major cause of childhood mortality and morbidity in Bangladesh. The aim of this study is to identify the significant risk factors for ARI in children less than five years of age. The data in this study comes from Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2004. In this study, a child was considered as having experienced ARI if she or he had cough in the last two weeks preceding the survey with any one of the three symptoms of short but rapid breathing, difficulty of breathing or labored inspiration. Logistic regression was used on various independent variables to find the risk factors. Results showed that child's age, sex, body weight and Vitamin A deficiency were correlated with prevalence of ARI. Additionally mother's characteristics like age, malnutrition, education level, and family's socio-economic status were found to be associated. Recommendations include more specific knowledge of ARI to adolescent mothers from the lowest wealth quintile. A community service which could include home visiting for health education, supplementation of vitamin A, and advice would be an advantage if provided for poor or teenaged pregnant women. This in turn would reduce low birth weight incidence, and subsequently reduce incidence of ARI among these children.Keywords: Acute respiratory infections (ARI); Risk factors; Infant; Child under 5 years; Bangladesh.{\textcopyright} 2009 JSR Publications.

abstract = {Background Undernutrition is common and has been recognized as a public health problem in Bangladesh. It has devastating effects on any population as it increases morbidity children and reduces the quality of life of all affected. The study was done with the objective to assess the undernutrition and morbidity profile in children who have completed exclusive breastfeeding. Methods This was a descriptive cross-sectional study, which was carried out among children aged 6-12 completed months attending a tertiary level hospital in Bangladesh. A total of 251 children were selected through convenient sampling from January to December 2015. Nutritional assessment was done in terms of underweight, stunting, and wasting. Results One hundred and forty-three (57.0{\%}) were boys while 108 (43.0{\%}) were girls. The prevalence of undernutrition (Z-score ≤-2) was observed in 11.2{\%}, 16.3{\%}, and 12.0{\%} based on stunting, underweight, and wasting. Among 251 children, 16.7{\%} were not suffering any diseases, whereas majorities (69.7{\%}) were suffering from single disease and 13.5{\%} were suffering from multiple diseases. Cough and fever (55.0{\%}), pneumonia (18.3{\%}), measles (9.9{\%}), and diarrhea (8.3{\%}) were the most common cause of infectious morbidity observed in children. Conclusions The prevalence of undernutrition was high in the study population, and it continues to be a public health burden because of its major effect on morbidity and impairment of intellectual and physical development in long-term. Increasing the practice of exclusive breastfeeding, the introduction of timely complementary feeding, and standard case management of morbidities would be beneficial to combat the problem of undernutrition.},

abstract = {This empirical study investigated the extent of malnutrition and factors associated with malnutrition amid children aged 0-59 months in Bangladesh using Bangladesh Demographic Health Survey data, 2014. To examine the extent of malnutrition among the children under five in Bangladesh, we used Height-for-age, weight-for-height and weight-for-age. The association between the selected factors and nutritional status were assessed and logistic regression models were fitted for the three indicators. 36.2{\%} children are stunted, 15{\%} are wasted and 33{\%} are underweight. Prevalence of stunting or underweight is lowest amongst children aged 0–6 months and highest at the age of 18 to 23 months (stunted 48{\%} and underweight 37{\%}). Wasting is highest in 0–6months. Odd of being stunted is 30{\%} to 50{\%} higher in Sylhet division as compared to other divisions. Other key covariates for stunting are urban area (OR = 1.226, p-value = 0.004), no or primary education of father (OR = 1.318, p-value {\textless} 0.001), no or primary education of mother (OR = 1.22, p-value = 0.002), underweight mothers (OR = 1.76, p-value {\textless}0.001) and wealth index poorest (OR = 2.892, p-value {\textless} 0.001). Important covariates for wasting are mother's occupation as physical labor (OR = 1.208, p-value = 0.018), underweight mothers (OR = 2.145, p-value {\textless}0.001) and wealth index poorest (OR = 2.892, p-value {\textless} 0.001). For underweight main covariates are: no or primary education of father (OR = 1.182, p-value = 0.011), no or primary education of mother (OR = 1.214, p-value = 0.002), mothers in physical labor (OR = 1.289, p-value {\textless} 0.001), underweight mothers (OR = 2.625, p-value {\textless} 0.001) and wealth index poorest (OR = 2.315, p-value {\textless} 0.001). In addition to the ongoing programs to improve child health, government may wish to design targeted nutrition intervention strategies to make sure that health information and health education are easily accessible for parents. The most vulnerable groups including the children from poorest socio-economic group or children in the urban area require special attention. Mothers should also be given focus while designing intervention programs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND In developing countries, infectious diseases such as diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections are the main cause of mortality and morbidity in infants aged less than one year. The importance of exclusive breastfeeding in the prevention of infectious diseases during infancy is well known. Although breastfeeding is almost universal in Bangladesh, the rates of exclusive breastfeeding remain low. This cohort study was designed to compare the prevalence of diarrhoea and acute respiratory infection (ARI) in infants according to their breastfeeding status in a prospective cohort of infants from birth to six months of age. METHODS A total of 351 pregnant women were recruited in the Anowara subdistrict of Chittagong. Breastfeeding practices and the 7-day prevalence of diarrhoea and ARI were recorded at monthly home visits. Prevalences were compared using chi-squared tests and logistic regression. RESULTS A total of 272 mother-infant pairs completed the study to six months. Infants who were exclusively breastfed for six months had a significantly lower 7-day prevalence of diarrhoea [AOR for lack of EBF = 2.50 (95{\%}CI 1.10, 5.69), p = 0.03] and a significantly lower 7-day prevalence of ARI [AOR for lack of EBF = 2.31 (95{\%}CI 1.33, 4.00), p {\textless} 0.01] than infants who were not exclusively breastfed. However, when the association between patterns of infant feeding (exclusive, predominant and partial breastfeeding) and illness was investigated in more detail, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of diarrhoea between exclusively [6.6{\%} (95{\%} CI 2.8, 10.4)] and predominantly breastfed infants [3.7{\%} (95{\%} CI 0.09, 18.3), (p = 0.56)]. Partially breastfed infants had a higher prevalence of diarrhoea than the others [19.2{\%} (95{\%} CI 10.4, 27.9), (p = 0.01)]. Similarly, although there was a large difference in prevalence in acute respiratory illness between exclusively [54.2{\%} (95{\%}CI 46.6, 61.8)] and predominantly breastfed infants [70.4{\%} (95{\%}CI 53.2, 87.6)] there was no significant difference in the prevalence (p = 0.17). CONCLUSION The findings suggest that exclusive or predominant breastfeeding can reduce rates of morbidity significantly in this region of rural Bangladesh.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES To describe breastfeeding practices and investigate the influence of exclusive breastfeeding in early infancy on the risk of infant deaths, especially those attributable to respiratory infections (ARI) and diarrhea. METHODS A prospective observational study was conducted on a birth cohort of 1677 infants who were born in slum areas of Dhaka in Bangladesh and followed from birth to 12 months of age. After enrollment at birth, the infants were visited 5 more times by 12 months of age. Verbal autopsy, based on a structured questionnaire, was used to assign a cause to the 180 reported deaths. Proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the effect of breastfeeding practices, introduced as a time-varying variable, after accounting for other variables, including birth weight. Overall neonatal, postneonatal and infant mortality, and mortality attributable to ARI and diarrhea were measured. RESULTS The proportion of infants who were breastfed exclusively was only 6{\%} at enrollment, increasing to 53{\%} at 1 month and then gradually declining to 5{\%} at 6 months of age. Predominant breastfeeding declined from 66{\%} at enrollment to 4{\%} at 12 months of age. Very few infants were not breastfed, whereas the proportion of partially breastfed infants increased with age. Breastfeeding practices did not differ between low and normal birth weight infants at any age. The overall infant mortality rate was 114 deaths per 1000 live births. Compared with exclusive breastfeeding in the first few months of life, partial or no breastfeeding was associated with a 2.23-fold higher risk of infant deaths resulting from all causes and 2.40- and 3.94-fold higher risk of deaths attributable to ARI and diarrhea, respectively. CONCLUSION The important role of appropriate breastfeeding practices in the survival of infants is clear from this analysis. The reduction of ARI deaths underscores the broad-based beneficial effect of exclusive breastfeeding in prevention of infectious diseases beyond its role in reducing exposure to contaminated food, which may have contributed to the strong protection against diarrhea deaths.},

abstract = {The World Health Organization recommends continuing breastfeeding up to 2 years of age or beyond for sound growth and development of children. In Bangladesh, continuation rates for breastfeeding have recently decreased and effective measures are required to counter this downward trend. Although recent years have seen economic development and reductions in poverty, Bangladesh still has the highest rate of child marriage worldwide. Thus, we aimed to clarify the factors influencing breastfeeding continuation, especially from the perspective of inequality and mother's age in Bangladesh, using data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2011. Event history analyses were performed during a 24-month follow-up period on 7,041 mothers with duration of breastfeeding as the outcome variable, with wealth index (an indicator for inequality) and mother's age used as the main explanatory variables. The results showed that poorer mothers were on the whole more likely to continue breastfeeding through 24 months after childbirth, and younger mothers were less likely to continue breastfeeding particularly past the first year. However, both younger and older mothers continued breastfeeding to the same extent within the first year after childbirth. Mother's age had time-varying effects on breastfeeding continuation, meaning that the effects on breastfeeding continuation were affected by the child's age. These findings imply that policymakers should be aware that efforts to reduce child marriage may increase the rate of breastfeeding continuation beyond the first year after childbirth. In contrast, efforts at poverty alleviation, aimed at preventing child marriage, may decrease the rate irrespective of the child's age.},

This study aimed to examine the factors influencing the uptake of infant and young child feeding messages promoted in TV spots that were launched and aired nationwide in Bangladesh. We conducted a mixed-methods study, using household surveys (n = 2,000) and semistructured interviews (n = 251) with mothers of children 0-23.9 months and other household members. Factors associated with TV spot viewing and comprehension were analysed using multivariable logistic regression models, and interview transcripts were analysed by systematic coding and iterative summaries. Exposure ranged from 36{\%} to 62{\%} across 6 TV spots, with comprehension ranging from 33{\%} to 96{\%} among those who viewed the spots. Factors associated with comprehension of TV spot messages included younger maternal age and receipt of home visits by frontline health workers. Three direct narrative spots showed correct message recall and strong believability, identification, and feasibility of practicing the recommended behaviours. Two spots that used a metaphorical and indirect narrative style were not well understood by respondents. Understanding the differences in the uptake factors may help to explain variability of impacts and ways to improve the design and implementation of mass media strategies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Despite growing evidence in support of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) among infants in the first 6 months of birth, the debate over the optimal duration of EBF continues. This study examines the effect of termination of EBF during the first 2, 4 and 6 months of birth on a set of adverse health and nutritional outcomes of infants. METHODS Three waves of Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey data were analysed using multivariate regression. The adverse health outcomes were: an episode of diarrhea, fever or acute respiratory infection (ARI) during the 2 weeks prior to the survey. Nutritional outcomes were assessed by stunting (height-for-age), wasting (weight-for-height) and underweight (weight-for-age). Population attributable fraction was calculated to estimate percentages of these six outcomes that could have been prevented by supplying EBF. RESULTS Fifty-six percent of infants were exclusively breastfed during the first 6 months. Lack of EBF increased the odds of diarrhea, fever and ARI. Among the babies aged 6 months or less 27.37{\%} of diarrhea, 13.24{\%} of fever and 8.94{\%} of ARI could have been prevented if EBF was not discontinued. If EBF was terminated during 0-2 months, 2-4 months the odds of becoming underweight were 2.16 and 2.01 times higher, respectively, than babies for whom EBF was not terminated. CONCLUSION Children who are not offered EBF up to 6 months of their birth may suffer from a range of infectious diseases and under-nutrition. Health promotion and other public health interventions should be enhanced to encourage EBF at least up to six-month of birth.

Breastfeeding norms differ within and between countries in South Asia, and evidence is needed to inform actions to protect, promote, and support optimal practices. This study examines time trends and predictors of EIBF, avoidance of prelacteal feeding (APF), EBF, and CBF to 2 years using survey data from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan since 1990. EIBF, APF, and EBF increased in Bangladesh, India, and Nepal from 1990 to 2016. EIBF and EBF increased in Pakistan from 1990 to 2013, but both EIBF and APF decreased in recent years. In Afghanistan, EIBF, APF, and EBF decreased from 2010 to 2015. CBF remained fairly constant across the region although prevalence varied by country. Significant (p {\textless} 0.05) predictors of suboptimal practices included caesarian delivery (4-25{\%}), home delivery, small size at birth, and low women's empowerment. Wealth, ethnic group, and caste had varied associations with breastfeeding. Progress towards optimal breastfeeding practices is uneven across the region and is of particular concern in Afghanistan and Pakistan. There are some common predictors of breastfeeding practices across the region, however country-specific predictors also exist. Policies, programs, and research should focus on improving breastfeeding in the context of women's low empowerment and strategies to support breastfeeding of infants born small or by caesarian section, in addition to country-specific actions.},

This study evaluated the effect of breastfeeding counselling on the duration of exclusive breastfeeding, and whether the timing of prenatal food and different micronutrient supplements further prolonged this duration. METHODS Pregnant women in Matlab, Bangladesh, were randomised to receive daily food supplements of 600 kcal at nine weeks of gestation or at the standard 20 weeks. They also were allocated to either 30 mg of iron and 400 $\mu$g folic acid, or the standard programme 60 mg of iron and folic acid or multiple micronutrients. At 30 weeks of gestation, 3188 women were randomised to receive either eight breastfeeding counselling sessions or the usual health messages. RESULTS The median duration of exclusive breastfeeding was 135 days in the counselling group and 75 days in the usual health message group (p {\textless} 0.001). Prenatal supplements did not modify the effects of counselling. Women in the usual health message group who were randomised to multiple micronutrients exclusively breastfed for 12 days longer than mothers receiving the standard iron-folate combination (p = 0.003).

This review identifies and collates evidence on the effectiveness of interventions to support optimal breastfeeding in five countries in South Asia: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan. A scoping review was conducted of peer-reviewed and grey literature. The 31 eligible studies included randomized trials and quasi-experimental designs that were conducted between 1990 and 2015. Data were collated regarding intervention design, characteristics, and effectiveness to support EIBF, APF, EBF, and CBF. Most studies reported a positive impact on breastfeeding outcomes, including 21/25 studies that examined EIBF, 15/19 studies that examined EBF, and 10/10 studies that examined APF. The only study that examined CBF reported no effect. Education, counselling, and maternal, newborn, and child health initiatives were common intervention types with positive effects on breastfeeding outcomes. Interventions were delivered in health facility, community, and home/family environments. Programmes and interventions that reached women and their families with repeated exposure and beginning during pregnancy were more likely to improve EIBF and EBF outcomes. Interventions with no impact on breastfeeding were characterized by short duration, irregular frequency, inappropriate timing, poor coverage, and targeting.},

abstract = {Research from richer countries finds that dairy consumption has strong positive associations with linear growth in children, but surprisingly little evidence exists for developing countries where diets are far less diversified. One exception is a recent economics literature using the notion of incomplete markets to estimate the impacts of cattle ownership on children's milk consumption and growth outcomes in Eastern Africa. In addition to external validity concerns, an obvious internal validity concern is that dairy producers may systematically differ from non-dairy households, particularly in terms of latent wealth or nutritional knowledge. We re-examine these concerns by applying a novel double difference model to data from rural Bangladesh, a country with relatively low levels of milk consumption and high rates of stunting. We exploit the fact that a cow's lactation cycles provide an exogenous source of variation in household milk supply, which allows us to distinguish between a control group of households that do not own cows, a treatment group that own cows that have produced milk, and a placebo group of cow-owning households that have not produced milk in the past 12 months. We find that household dairy production increases height-for-age Z scores by 0.52 standard deviations in the critical 6-23 month growth window, though in the first year of life we find that household dairy supply is associated with a 21.7 point decline in the rate of breastfeeding. The results therefore suggest that increasing access to dairy products can be extremely beneficial to children's nutrition, but may need to be accompanied by efforts to improve nutritional knowledge and appropriate breastfeeding practices.},

abstract = {Considerable advances have occurred in recent years in the scientific knowledge of the benefits of breastfeeding, the mechanisms underlying these benefits, and in the clinical management of breastfeeding. This policy statement on breastfeeding replaces the 1997 policy statement of the American Academy of Pediatrics and reflects this newer knowledge and the supporting publications. The benefits of breastfeeding for the infant, the mother, and the community are summarized, and recommendations to guide the pediatrician and other health care professionals in assisting mothers in the initiation and maintenance of breastfeeding for healthy term infants and high-risk infants are presented. The policy statement delineates various ways in which pediatricians can promote, protect, and support breastfeeding not only in their individual practices but also in the hospital, medical school, community, and nation.},
